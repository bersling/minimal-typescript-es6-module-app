# minimal-typescript-es6-module

Absolutely minimal app to get an app with es6 modules and typescript running.

To get it running you can't just open index.html, you need a server.
Easiest: Open Terminal, go to this folder and enter `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
Then see output at `127.0.0.1:8000`.
